# Claude Sounds Configuration
# Copy this file to ~/.config/claude-sounds/config
#
# All settings can also be overridden with environment variables:
#   CLAUDE_SOUNDS_THRESHOLD - overrides THRESHOLD
#   CLAUDE_SOUNDS_DIR       - overrides SOUNDS_DIR

# Minimum session duration (in seconds) before playing completion sound.
# Sessions shorter than this won't trigger a sound on completion.
# Default: 60
THRESHOLD=60

# Custom sounds directory. Place your own sound files here:
#   - completion.mp3  (played when a long task completes)
#   - needs_input.mp3 (played when Claude needs permission)
#   - attention.mp3   (played for MCP elicitation dialogs)
# Default: uses the plugin's built-in sounds
# SOUNDS_DIR="$HOME/.config/claude-sounds/sounds"
